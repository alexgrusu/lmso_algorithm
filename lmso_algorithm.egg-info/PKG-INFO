Description: # lmso_algorithm
        
        The least-mean-square (LMS) and the normalized least-mean-square (NLMS) algorithms require a trade-off between fast convergence 
        and low misadjustment, obtained by choosing the control parameters. In general, time variable parameters are proposed 
        according to different rules. Many studies on the optimization of the NLMS algorithm imply time variable control parameters 
        according some specific criteria.
        
        The optimized LMS (LMSO) algorithm [1] for system identification is developed in the context of a state variable model, assuming 
        that the unknown system acts as a time-varying system, following a first-order Markov model [2]. 
        
        The proposed algorithm follows an optimization problem and introduces a variable step-size in order to minimize the system misalignment
